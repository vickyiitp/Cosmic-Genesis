# Cosmic Genesis: Deployment Guide

Congratulations! Your interactive space discovery application, "Cosmic Genesis," is complete and ready to be shared with the world. This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy it.

## 1. Project Overview

Cosmic Genesis is a visually rich, scroll-based web application that takes users on a journey through the evolution of the cosmos. It features stunning parallax backgrounds, interactive celestial visuals, and content dynamically generated by the Google Gemini API.

## 2. Prerequisites: Google Gemini API Key

The application requires a Google Gemini API key to generate the names and descriptions of stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies.

1.  **Obtain your API Key**: Visit the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to create your free API key.
2.  **Keep it Secret**: Your API key is like a password. Do not share it publicly or commit it directly into your code repository.

You will need to provide this key to your deployment service as an **environment variable**.

## 3. Deployment Instructions

Deploying this project is straightforward because it consists of static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The easiest way to deploy is using a modern hosting platform like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

Here is a general guide using **Vercel** as an example (the steps are very similar for Netlify):

### Step 1: Push Your Code to a Git Provider

1.  Make sure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) account.
2.  Create a new repository.
3.  Upload all the project files (`index.html`, `index.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `components/`, etc.) to this new repository.

### Step 2: Deploy with Vercel

1.  **Sign Up/Log In**: Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and create an account (you can sign up with your GitHub account for easy integration).

2.  **Import Your Project**:
    *   From your Vercel dashboard, click "Add New... > Project".
    *   Select the Git repository you just created. Vercel will automatically detect that you have a static site.

3.  **Configure the Project**:
    *   Vercel's default settings for a static site should work perfectly. No build command or output directory is needed.
    *   Before deploying, expand the **"Environment Variables"** section.
    *   Add a new variable:
        *   **Name**: `API_KEY`
        *   **Value**: Paste your Google Gemini API key here.
    *   Click "Add".

4.  **Deploy**:
    *   Click the "Deploy" button.
    *   Vercel will build and deploy your site. In a few moments, you'll be given a public URL where you can view your live "Cosmic Genesis" application!

### Alternative: Running Locally

If you just want to run the project on your own computer, you can use any simple local web server.

1.  **Install a Server**: If you have Node.js installed, you can install a simple server:
    ```bash
    npm install -g serve
    ```
2.  **Run the Server**:
    *   Open your terminal or command prompt.
    *   Navigate to the root directory of your project (the one containing `index.html`).
    *   Run the command:
    ```bash
    serve .
    ```
3.  **View the App**: The terminal will give you a local address (like `http://localhost:3000`). Open this in your browser to see the app.
    *Note: The Gemini API might not work locally this way unless you have a mechanism to handle the `process.env.API_KEY`. For local development, you might temporarily place your key in the code, but **NEVER** commit it to your repository.*

Your cosmic journey is now ready for launch!
